             in the fields of environmental, ecological and life sciences. It was rechristened as
              Maharshi Dayanand University in 1977 after the name of a great visionary and social 
              reformer, Maharshi Dayanand. It had a unitary and residential character in its nascent 
              stage, but became an affiliating University in November 1978. The University secured the
